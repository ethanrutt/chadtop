# Chadtop
This is yet another `top` clone. The purpose of this project is to learn more
about the linux operating system and learn the rust programming language, so
I'm fine with solving a problem that's been solved before.

## TODO
- GPU Info
- RAM Info
- Hard Drive Info
- Network Speed
- setup TUI
